## ScaleFEx℠: Feature Extraction for High-Content Imaging

ScaleFEx℠ (Scalable Feature Extraction ) is an open-source Python pipeline designed to extract biologically meaningful features from large high-content imaging (HCI) datasets. By leveraging artificial intelligence, ScaleFEx℠ enhances the analysis of morphological profiles, particularly in distinguishing disease phenotypes that are indiscernible to the human eye.

### Key Features
- **Robust Feature Extraction**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to distill complex image data into critical features that drive insights into cellular phenotypes.
- **High-Content Imaging Focus**: Tailored for large-scale HCI screens, addressing challenges of scale, variability, and high-dimensionality in biomedical imaging.
