# HCI PIPELINE PARAMETERS 

# GENERAL PARAMETERS
vector_type: 'scalefex' #'scalefex', 'embeddings', '' for QC only, 'coordinates' for coordinates of cells
resource: 'local' #'local', 'AWS' # 'local' for local computation, 'AWS' for cloud computing
n_of_workers: 40 # int, n of workers to use in parallel. LOWER FOR TESTING PURPOSES

# Parameters for file retrieval and saving:
exp_folder: 'HTF0001/' #'/mnt/10b1e8d4-f3a8-46e5-9a1a-c197b4f39011/HTF0002/' # Main folder with subfolders of plates (each with a subfolder of images)
experiment_name: 'HTF0001' # Experiment name used to identify the experiment
saving_folder: '/home/biancamigliori/Documents/HCI_Projects/Try' # folder to save results (e.g., embeddings, scalefex, coordinates, QC)
plates: ['201'] # list of plates to be processed (each should be in one plate subdirectory name)
max_file_size: 40 #2000 # max file size in MB before a new file is created

# image file parsing parameters:
plate_identifiers: ['_CV384W_','_'] #identifier for finding the plate number; should directly precede and follow the plate identifier 
pattern: 'Images/<Well>f<Site>p<Plane(2)>-<Channel(3)>.<ext>' # pattern of the image file: specify all the characters that make up the filepath indicating the location and 
exts: ['tiff',] # possible extensions of images to be processed
image_size: [2160,2160] # size of images to be processed in pixels (height, width)

# COMPUTATION PARAMETERS
channel: ['ch4','ch1', 'ch5', 'ch3', 'ch2'] # channels in order to be processed. NOTE: the nuclear channel should be first ['ch1','ch2', 'ch3',  'ch4']#
zstack: True # set to True if you have multi-plane images and you want to process max projections of the planes
ROI: 90 # half the size of the cropped area around the cell (e.g., 150 for 300x300 ROI) 90
downsampling: 1 # Downsampling ratio
QC: True # if true, compute a Quality Control step
FFC: True # if true, compute a flat field correction image to correct for non-uniform background illumination
FFC_n_images: 500 # n of images to be used to produce the background trend image for the Flat Field Correction

## NUCLEI SEGMENTATION PARAMETERS
csv_coordinates: '' # '' if you don't want to use a pre-computed coordinates file
segmenting_function: 'Nuclei_segmentation.nuclei_location_extraction' 
save_coordinates: True # if true, saves a csv file with the coordinates for cells for each plate
min_cell_size: 200 # min area threshold for mask (any object with smaller area will be removed)
max_cell_size: 100000 # max area threshold for mask (any object with bigger area will be removed)
visualization: False # if true, the segmentation masks of the entire field will be visualizaed (using matplotlib). NOTE: we suggest to visualize the masks for testing, but to turn it off during the processing of large screens

## Scalefex settings
RNA_channel: 'ch5' # channel with RNA stain (if any)
Mito_channel: 'ch2' # channel with mitochondrial stain (if any)
neurite_tracing: '' # channel where to compute tracing (if any)'ch3'
visualize_masks: False # visualize the segmentation mask from each channel. NOTE: we suggest to visualize the masks for testing, but to turn it off during the processing of large screens
visualize_crops: False # visualizes the crop of the cell. This helps setting the best ROI size, but we suggest to visualize the crop for testing, but to turn it off during the processing of large screens

## AWS Specific parameters
s3_bucket: 'nyscf-scalefex'
nb_subsets: 6 #How many machines per plate
subset_index: 1 #Which subset is being computed
region: 'us-east-1'
instance_type: 'c5.12xlarge' # Machine type 
amazon_image_id: 'ami-06c68f701d8090592' # AMI linked to region
ScaleFExSubnetA: 'subnet-0f55e119abeabb79d' 
ScaleFExSubnetB: 'subnet-0f2fffa1123aba4e7'
ScaleFExSubnetC: 'subnet-0811845bbe0f6b56e'
